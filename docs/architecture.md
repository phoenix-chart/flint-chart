# Architecture

Flint is a library-agnostic intermediate language for visualization. Every `assemble*()` entry point uses the same **compiler frontend** and **optimizer**; only the **code generator** changes by backend.

For motivation and spec examples, see [Overview](/documentation/overview). For input types, see [API reference](/documentation/api-reference).

# §1 Design principles

1. **Semantics first** — `semantic_types` guide parsing, aggregation, zero baseline, diverging detection, and formatting. Raw storage types are only the starting point.
2. **Minimal chart surface** — `chart_spec` supplies chart type and channel bindings, usually in about 10 lines. Axes, scales, legends, and step sizes are compiler-derived.
3. **Dynamic templates** — Each `chartType` maps to a `ChartTemplateDef`; its `instantiate()` hook consumes the full compilation context and adapts to cardinality and semantics.
4. **No UI dependencies** — The core is pure TypeScript (`packages/flint-js`), so it can run from agents, notebooks, servers, or this site. A Python package is planned for a later release.

Most design logic lives in Stages 1–2 and is identical across backends.

# §2 Three-stage pipeline

![Overview of the Flint architecture](figs/overview.png)

| Stage | Role | Implementation | Key outputs |
|-------|------------|----------------|-------------|
| **1. Compiler frontend** | Resolve semantic context | Phase 0 — `resolveChannelSemantics()` | `ChannelSemantics` per channel |
| **2. Optimizer** | Fit layout to canvas | Phase 1 — `computeLayout()`, `filterOverflow()` | `LayoutResult`, truncated data |
| **3. Code generator** | Emit library-native spec | Phase 2 — `build*Encodings()`, `template.instantiate()` | VL / EC / CJS spec |

# §3 Stage 1 — Compiler frontend

Resolution happens in two layers; [Semantic Type §4](/documentation/semantic-types#4-compilation-pipeline) describes the full pipeline.

### Field properties

Per column, independent of chart: format class, aggregation role, domain shape, diverging hints, canonical order. Driven by `type-registry.ts` and optional inline annotations (`intrinsicDomain`, `unit`, `sortOrder`).

### Channel properties

Chart-context grounding. The same `YearMonth` field may be temporal on `x` in a line chart but categorical on `color` in another view. Channel semantics prevent year-month integers from being treated as quantitative magnitudes.

**IR:** `ChannelSemantics` — flat, backend-agnostic record consumed by layout and all templates.

Tiered types (T0 → T1 → T2) allow graceful degradation when agents supply coarse labels.

### Named View Transformations

Flint exposes some alternatives as **named views** instead of asking the user or agent to rewrite a chart spec. A named view is a small transformation of the encoding assignment: flip the axes, exchange a categorical axis with a color series, route a series into facets, or re-render the same fields as a sibling chart type. The host stores only the selected state id in `chart_spec.chartProperties.pivot`; the compiler recomputes the resulting encoding map and runs the ordinary semantics, overflow, layout, and backend generation pipeline on that view.

The model is group-theoretic but deliberately practical. Start from the authored assignment `a0` and walk the orbit generated by four operators:

| Symbol | Generator | Example state id | Meaning |
|--------|-----------|------------------|---------|
| `τ` | transpose | `flip:x-y` | flip two axis slots wholesale, preserving occupancy |
| `σ` | permute | `swap:y-color` | exchange a position field with a same-profile auxiliary channel |
| `γ` | shift | `series:row` | route one discrete series field among color/group/facet channels |
| `θ` | transition | `type:Strip Plot` | re-render the same routed fields with a sibling template |

The visible View control is the finite orbit after validity checks and deduplication. Deduplication is the stabilizer quotient in concrete form: flip twice returns to `Default`, faceting then jittering can collapse to the same Strip Plot as jittering directly, and a chart-type round trip such as Scatter → Strip Plot → Scatter folds back onto the authored scatter. Compatibility checks are also typed: `σ` only swaps within the same field profile (measure with measure, category with category), while `τ` is allowed to cross profiles because it flips axis slots, not field roles. Line charts omit `τ`, so Flint never offers a vertical line chart.

Because the orbit is computed over Flint's backend-neutral encoding IR, the same View state ids apply across Vega-Lite, ECharts, and Chart.js. Each backend receives the already-transformed encoding map; only `θ` requires backend-specific template lookup so the sibling chart's own instantiation logic takes over.

# §4 Stage 2 — Optimizer

The optimizer receives `baseSize` (the target) and an optional `canvasSize` ceiling, then produces a `LayoutResult` that keeps the chart readable within the available space.

### Local optimization

Each layout dimension (x, y, group, facet column/row, radius) is a flexible container:

| Encoding class | Behavior |
|----------------|----------|
| Discrete (bars, heatmap cells) | Compress toward minimum readable step; stretch canvas if needed |
| Continuous (scatter, line) | Stretch when mark density exceeds overlap budget |

### Global optimization

Aspect ratio (banking-to-45° for connected marks), facet row/column wrapping, and non-Cartesian charts (treemap, gauge, pie) sized from component counts.

Implementation models: [Auto Layout Algorithm](/documentation/layout-model) — §2 elastic budget, §3 gas pressure, §4 circumference, §5 area.

---

# §5 Stage 3 — Code generator

Backend generators translate the optimized context into library-native syntax. Each `chartType` registers a **dynamic template**:

| `ChartTemplateDef` field | Role |
|--------------------------|------|
| `chart` | Public name (`"Grouped Bar Chart"`) — matches `chart_spec.chartType` |
| `template` | Native spec skeleton |
| `channels` | Allowed encodings |
| `markCognitiveChannel` | `position` / `length` / `area` / `color` — zero baseline and stretch class |
| `declareLayoutMode?` | Axis flags before layout |
| `instantiate()` | Emit spec from `InstantiateContext` |

Registries: `vlTemplateDefs`, `ecTemplateDefs`, `cjsTemplateDefs`. Lookup: `vlGetTemplateDef(name)`, etc.

New backends implement Stage 3 only; the frontend and optimizer stay unchanged. See [Extending backends](/documentation/adding-a-backend).

# §6 Inputs

| Part | API | Specifies |
|------|-----|-----------|
| Raw data | `data` | Row table for parsers and layout |
| **dataSpec** | `semantic_types` | Field meaning; reused across charts on the same dataset |
| **chartSpec** | `chart_spec` | `chartType` + `encodings`; cheap to edit during exploration |

LLM agents typically infer `semantic_types` once, then iterate on `chart_spec`: line → heatmap → grouped bar → waterfall → sunburst on one semantic layer.

---

# §7 Overflow and warnings

When discrete cardinality exceeds the canvas budget, the optimizer filters data and attaches `ChartWarning` metadata instead of rendering an unreadable chart. Strategy priority and `_warnings` inspection are covered in [API reference §8](/documentation/api-reference#8-overflow-and-warnings).
